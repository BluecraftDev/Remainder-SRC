# Remainder-SRC
This was a project that i was working on it is now open sourced, some stuff is skidded, please feel free to contribute.. I plan to continue to working on it but as of right now I dont have much motivation

* Im still hoping to be active, I have added some comments for anyone who does not know java and would like to skid the client, and also for people who know java and cant read my eye watering code, I would honestly apprecitate if you make pull requests, I will start assinging special roles in the discord for contributors. dm me @ Slum#8974 and tell me that u did something and tell me ur github and ill give the role!

* Thank you to everyone who helps out! @Choppa @Lappun0 @sdxqw

If you are new to java I highly recommend making pull requests! they can help with building skill, they dont have to be anything crazy, fixing a typo even helps! please contribute!
